Crime Prediction 🕵️‍♀️📊

📌 About the Project
Crime Prediction is a comprehensive data science project aimed at analyzing crime data in Türkiye from 2013 to 2020 and predicting future crime density.
The project uses official crime statistics published by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK), enriched with socio-demographic information (age, education, gender, marital status, etc.). Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques were applied to generate crime density predictions, time series forecasts, and risk maps.

This work goes beyond being an academic study — it is designed to provide data-driven contributions to public safety, urban planning, and social policy development. The outputs can help decision-makers take preventive measures in high-crime areas and allocate resources more effectively.

🎯 Project Objectives
This project was conducted with the following goals:
Analyze crime rates in Türkiye by year, city, and crime type
Examine the impact of socio-demographic factors (age, gender, education, marital status) on crime rates
Predict crime density using machine learning and deep learning techniques
Forecast future crime trends with time series analysis
Classify cities into safe, medium-risk, and high-risk groups using clustering methods
Visualize crime data with clear and interactive maps/graphs

📊 Key Findings
Random Forest and DNN achieved the highest accuracy in predicting crime density
ARIMA yielded the lowest error rates in time series forecasting
Major cities (Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir) were found in the highest-risk group
The 18–34 age range accounted for the highest rates in many crime types
Low-to-medium education levels showed higher crime rates; as education increased, overall crime rates tended to decrease
